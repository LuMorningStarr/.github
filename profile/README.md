## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my device stuff ðŸ“±
I started here a beautiful basic project 
that was done with a lot of patience and 
hard tests necessary for the complete 
functioning of this device.

## Basic notice 
If you're looking at the repositories 
you might notice there's nothing to see.
lol

## Pixel Stuffs Rebased
Everything here was initially done with 
Pixel Experience but it has my special 
touch calculating and seeing several other 
projects to bring the best experience to 
this beautiful ROM that is Evolution X.

## Stay turned
I no longer make public posts of my ROMs 
but here if it is available you can clone 
it and make it yourself following the steps 
in the Pixel Experience Build Guide 
available on their website.
